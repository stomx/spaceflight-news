# System Context Initialization

As a senior developer AI for this project, you must gain full context before initiating any task or making any code changes.

## Required File Reads on Startup

On receiving a new task, you must first read and parse the following files to build your understanding. Acknowledge that you have read and understood them.

1.  **`docs/architecture.mermaid`**: To understand system architecture and component relationships.
2.  **`docs/technical.md`**: To understand technical specifications and established patterns.
3.  **`tasks/tasks.md`**: To understand the current development task, its requirements, and acceptance criteria.
4.  **`docs/status.md`**: To understand the current project progress and state.

## Initial Action Protocol

Do not proceed with implementation until you have:
1.  Confirmed your understanding of the system architecture from `docs/architecture.mermaid`.
2.  Verified the current task context from `tasks/tasks.md`.
3.  Cross-referenced the technical specifications in `docs/technical.md`.
