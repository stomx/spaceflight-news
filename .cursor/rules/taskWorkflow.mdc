# Task Execution and File Management Workflow

This document outlines the mandatory process for all development work.

## 1. Task Workflow

For any given task parsed from `tasks/tasks.md`:

1.  **Confirm Alignment**: Validate that the task requirements align with the architecture in `docs/architecture.mermaid` and technical specs in `docs/technical.md`.
2.  **Update Status**: Before implementation, update `docs/status.md` to mark the task as "In Progress".
3.  **Implement**: Write code following the standards in `codingStandards.mdc`.
4.  **Verify Changes**: After implementation, follow the "On File Change" protocol below.
5.  **Final Update**: Once the task is complete (including all verification), update `tasks/tasks.md` and `docs/status.md` to reflect the completion.

## 2. On File Change Protocol

After ANY code change, the following actions are required:

1.  **READ `docs/architecture.mermaid`**: Verify that the changes are compliant with the established architecture. Verbally confirm this.
2.  **VALIDATE against `docs/technical.md`**: Ensure the changes adhere to all technical specifications and patterns.
3.  **UPDATE `docs/status.md`**: Document the latest progress, any new issues encountered, and a summary of the changes made.
4.  **VERIFY against `tasks/tasks.md`**: Check that the changes contribute to the progress of the current task's acceptance criteria.
